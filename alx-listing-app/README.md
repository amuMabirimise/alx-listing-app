This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

# **ALX Listing App**

## **Description**
The **ALX Listing App** is a modern web application inspired by the Airbnb platform, designed to showcase property listings with a clean and responsive user interface. This project leverages cutting-edge technologies like **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** to ensure high performance, maintainability, and scalability. By building reusable components, we aim to create a modular, efficient, and developer-friendly codebase that adheres to industry best practices.

This app focuses on providing a seamless user experience and serves as a practical demonstration of how to structure and develop feature-rich applications using modern frameworks and tools.

## **Key Features**
- **Next.js Framework**: A React-based framework optimized for server-side rendering, routing, and API handling.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Enforces type safety throughout the project, improving code reliability and reducing runtime errors.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides a utility-first approach to styling, enabling the creation of responsive and aesthetically pleasing designs efficiently.
- **Reusable Components**: Modular components like `Card` and `Button` ensure reusability, maintainability, and consistency across the application.
- **Asset Management**: Centralized storage for static files such as images and SVGs, promoting better organization and easier access.

---

## **Project Structure**
The project is organized to ensure clarity and ease of navigation:

- **`components/common`**: Houses reusable UI components such as `Card` and `Button`, designed for consistent use throughout the app.
- **`interfaces`**: Contains TypeScript interfaces for defining the structure and types of data used across components, ensuring type safety and predictability.
- **`constants`**: Stores reusable constants like API endpoints, configuration settings, and UI-related text.
- **`public/assets`**: Contains static assets, such as placeholder property images and SVG icons, to streamline resource management.
- **`pages`**: Hosts the appâ€™s pages, with routing handled by Next.js for a seamless navigation experience.

## **Prerequisites**
To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **npm** (v7.x or later) or **yarn**
- A modern web browser for viewing the app

---

## **Installation Instructions**
To set up the ALX Listing App locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-listing-app.git
cd alx-listing-app

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
